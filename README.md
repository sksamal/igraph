The igraph library
------------------

igraph is a library for creating and manipulating graphs. 
It is intended to be as powerful (ie. fast) as possible to enable the
analysis of large graphs. 

See http://igraph.org for installation instructions, 
and documentation. 

Igraph can also be used from R, see https://github.com/igraph/rigraph,
and from Python, see https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph
